## 🎯 Studio Vision

JellyBolt Games is an indie **app publisher** — games AND utilities. We build **instant-play mobile games** and **lightweight utility tools**, all under the same neon-lit brand. Every app loads in under a second, looks like it was dipped in liquid lightning, and earns ad revenue while it sleeps.

This roadmap takes us from **3 Play Store apps** to a **full publisher portfolio** of 20+ titles — games for engagement, utilities for steady passive ad income.

### Brand DNA

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Publisher** | JellyBolt Games |
| **Visual identity** | Dark backgrounds (`#050510`), neon green accent (`#00ff88`), electric cyan (`#58a6ff`), gold highlights (`#ffcc00`) |
| **Icon / motif** | ⚡ Lightning bolt |
| **Tagline** | "Fun hits different." |
| **Voice** | Energetic, Gen-Z friendly, no-BS. Think "your friend who found the best game and is screaming about it" |
| **App naming** | Game name as title (e.g., "Dungeon Bolt", "BrainRot Quiz Battle"). Publisher attribution via Play Store developer profile |
| **Ethical stance** | No loot boxes, no pay-to-win, no energy gates. Players pay for expression, never for advantage. |

## 1. ⚡ Standalone App Expansion — Top 8 + New Flagship

We're pulling the best games out of the collection and shipping them as standalone Play Store apps. Each one gets its own store listing, screenshots, icon, and Play Store category — built to rank independently.

### 💎 NEW FLAGSHIP — Gem Storm (Match-3 Puzzle)

> **This is the game that will define JellyBolt's DAU numbers.**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | **Gem Storm** |
| **Package** | `com.jellybolt.gemstorm` |
| **Category** | `GAME_PUZZLE` |
| **Engine** | Phaser 3 (CDN) — smooth gem animations, particle effects, tweens |
| **Priority** | 🔴 **HIGHEST** — Phase 2A, parallel with JellyBolt Core SDK |
| **Estimated size** | ~120 KB game + Phaser CDN |

Match-3 is the #1 casual mobile genre by revenue. Candy Crush alone makes $4M/day. We're not building Candy Crush — we're building a **JellyBolt-flavored match-3** that's lightning-fast, neon-gorgeous, and designed to be played for months.

#### Core Mechanics

**Board:** 8×8 grid of colored gems (6 gem types + special gems)

**Basic play:**
- Swap two adjacent gems to create a row/column of 3+ matching gems
- Matched gems explode with neon particle effects, new gems cascade from above
- Chain reactions (cascades) = massive score multipliers

**Power-up combos (the addiction layer):**

| Combo | Creates | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 4 in a row | ⚡ **Lightning Gem** | Clears entire row OR column (player chooses direction) |
| 5 in a row | 💎 **Bolt Gem** | Clears ALL gems of one color on the board |
| L-shape or T-shape | 💥 **Storm Gem** | 3×3 explosion around the gem |
| 2 special gems swapped | 🌪️ **Mega Storm** | Combines both effects — devastating board clear |

#### Progression System

**100+ Levels** across 10 worlds, each world with a visual theme:

| World | Theme | Visual Style | Levels |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Neon Caverns | Dark caves, glowing crystals, green (#00ff88) | 1–10 |
| 2 | Cyber Grid | Tron-style grid, cyan (#58a6ff) | 11–20 |
| 3 | Magma Core | Lava flows, red/orange | 21–30 |
| 4 | Frozen Peaks | Ice crystals, white/blue | 31–40 |
| 5 | Void Storm | Deep space, purple/black | 41–50 |
| 6 | Golden Temple | Ancient ruins, gold (#ffcc00) | 51–60 |
| 7 | Toxic Swamp | Radioactive green, bubbling | 61–70 |
| 8 | Cloud Kingdom | Floating islands, soft pastels | 71–80 |
| 9 | Shadow Realm | Inverted colors, dark motif | 81–90 |
| 10 | Bolt Nexus | JellyBolt HQ — all effects combined | 91–100+ |

**Level objectives** (variety keeps it fresh):

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Score target | "Score 5,000 points in 30 moves" |
| Clear gems | "Clear 20 blue gems" |
| Drop items | "Drop 3 keys to the bottom row" |
| Break obstacles | "Destroy all ice blocks" |
| Chain target | "Create 5 cascades in one level" |
| Boss levels | "Defeat the Void Guardian" (every 10th level) |

**Star ratings:** 1–3 ⚡bolts per level based on score thresholds. Completionists will replay to get 3 bolts on every level.

**Level map:** Scrollable world map (like Candy Crush / Monument Valley) showing progress, locked levels, and boss gates.

#### Lives System

- **5 lives maximum**
- Lose a life when you fail a level (run out of moves / time)
- **1 life regenerates every 20 minutes** (not 30 — we're kinder than King)
- **Watch a rewarded ad** → get 1 bonus life immediately
- **Spend 50 ⚡coins** → refill all 5 lives
- **Daily login** → free life refill
- **No paywall** — you can always play again in 20 minutes, or earn coins through other JellyBolt games

#### Daily & Social Features

- **Daily challenge level:** Unique level every 24h, bonus ⚡coins + XP for completion
- **Streak bonus:** Play daily → streak multiplier on ⚡coin rewards
- **Weekly tournament:** Top scorer on a special weekly level gets exclusive cosmetic gem skin
- **Cross-game integration:** JellyBolt Core SDK — XP, ⚡coins, achievements all shared with other JellyBolt games

- Gems: Rounded squares with inner glow, subtle pulsing animation
- Matches: Neon lightning effect connecting matched gems, then shatter + particles
- Cascades: Screen-shake, combo counter flies up ("×3!", "×4!", "MEGA!")
- Special gems: Visible lightning/storm/bolt effects inside the gem
- Level complete: ⚡ bolt strikes from top, star rating flies in, confetti particles
- Background: Per-world themed backdrop (caves, grid, lava, etc.) with subtle parallax

#### Monetization (Ethical, Per Revenue Strategy)

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Rewarded video ads** | Watch ad → +5 moves on a failed level, OR +1 life |
| **Interstitial ads** | Between levels (max 1 per 3 levels, skippable after 5s) |
| **Banner ad** | Bottom of screen during gameplay |
| **Future IAP** (Phase 5) | ⚡coin packs for lives/boosters. Cosmetic gem skins. NO pay-to-win level skips. |

#### Why This Is the #1 Priority

1. **Match-3 = highest DAU genre on mobile.** Users play 5-10 sessions/day.
2. **Session length sweet spot:** 2-5 minutes per level = perfect for ads between levels.
3. **100+ levels = months of content** before users run out. Expandable with new worlds.
4. **Lives system = return visits.** Users come back every 20 min when lives refill.
5. **Cross-game synergy:** ⚡coins earned in Gem Storm power up ALL JellyBolt games.
6. **ASO keywords:** "match 3", "puzzle game", "gem puzzle" = massive search volume.
7. **Phaser 3 engine:** Buttery-smooth animations that make the game FEEL premium.

## 2. 🔧 Game Engine Strategy

### Why We Stay JavaScript-Native

| Engine | WebView OK? | Build Size | Our Verdict |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Vanilla Canvas + JS** | ✅ Perfect | 7–65 KB | **Our core stack.** Instant load, offline, tiny APKs. Keep using for 2D games. |
| **Phaser 3** | ✅ Excellent | 200 KB (CDN) | **Best upgrade for 2D.** Particle effects, physics, sprite sheets. Use for next-gen 2D titles. |
| **Three.js** | ✅ Excellent | 150 KB (CDN) | **Already in use** (Space Shooter 3D). Best 3D-to-size ratio. |
| **BabylonJS** | ✅ Good | 500 KB–3 MB (CDN) | **Best for complex 3D.** Orbit cameras, PBR materials, full scene graphs. |
| **Unity WebGL** | ❌ No | 15–50 MB | **Rejected.** WASM overhead, SharedArrayBuffer issues, 3-10s startup. Kills the "instant play" brand promise. |
| **Godot HTML5** | ⚠️ Marginal | 5–15 MB | **Not worth it.** Still too heavy for WebView. Marginal quality gain over JS. |

**Decision:** Phaser 3 (2D) + Three.js/BabylonJS (3D). JavaScript is our competitive advantage — games that load before the splash screen fades.

### 3 New Game Concepts (Phase 4)

These use advanced engines while staying true to the JellyBolt aesthetic: neon colors, dark backgrounds, fast gameplay.

#### 🏎️ Neon Drift
> *Low-poly neon racing. Drift through procedural tracks. One thumb, infinite speed.*

- **Engine:** Three.js + cannon-es physics
- **Package:** `com.jellybolt.neondrift`
- **Visual style:** Synthwave tracks glowing against void-black space. Neon trail particles.
- **Mechanic hook:** Drift-to-boost. The more you drift, the faster you go. But lose control and you're toast.
- **Estimated size:** ~50 KB game + CDN libs

#### ⚡ Phantom Arena
> *Top-down hack-and-slash. Procedural dungeons. Pixel-perfect carnage.*

- **Engine:** Phaser 3
- **Package:** `com.jellybolt.phantomarena`
- **Visual style:** JellyBolt neon-dark with sprite-based characters and particle explosions
- **Mechanic hook:** Combo chains. Kill enemies fast enough and your damage multiplier climbs. Stop killing and it resets. Never. Stop. Swinging.
- **Estimated size:** ~80 KB game + CDN lib

#### 🌌 Star Colonies
> *Build your empire among the stars. Trade, expand, defend. One more turn...*

- **Engine:** BabylonJS
- **Package:** `com.jellybolt.starcolonies`
- **Visual style:** Low-poly space stations orbiting glowing planets. UI in JellyBolt neon green on dark panels.
- **Mechanic hook:** "One more turn" syndrome. Each turn takes 30 seconds but the consequences unfold across 5 turns. You can't stop mid-chain.
- **Estimated size:** ~100 KB game + CDN lib

---

## 3. ⚡ JellyBolt Core — The Addiction Framework

A shared JavaScript module (`games/shared/jellybolt-core.js`) loaded by every game, providing a unified player identity and progression system across the entire JellyBolt ecosystem.

**Design principle:** No dark patterns. Engagement through genuine reward loops, not manipulation. Aligned with our revenue strategy: "Players pay for expression, never for advantage."

5. **Session bonus**: "10-minute bonus: +5 ⚡coins!" — rewards longer play
6. **Urgency**: "Daily challenge resets in 4h 23m" — time pressure
7. **Social proof**: "You're top 15% in Bounce Blitz!" — competitive drive (local data)

### 3.7 💰 Currency System

## 5. 🔧 Utility Apps Line — Passive Ad Revenue

### The Strategy

Games drive engagement. Utilities drive **steady, predictable ad revenue**.

Every utility app is a separate Play Store listing under the "JellyBolt Games" publisher. They're fast to build (HTML5 WebView or lightweight native), solve a real problem, and monetize through banner + interstitial ads. A user who opens a calculator 5 times a day is 5 ad impressions a day, 365 days a year — without us building any new content.

### Why This Works for JellyBolt

| Factor | Games | Utilities |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **User sessions** | 1–3/day, 5–15 min each | 3–10/day, 30 sec–2 min each |
| **Retention** | Needs constant content updates | "Set and forget" — user keeps the app forever |
| **Ad revenue model** | Rewarded video (higher CPM, lower volume) | Banner + interstitial (lower CPM, MUCH higher volume) |
| **Build effort** | Medium–High (game design, balance, art) | Low (standard UI, solved problems) |
| **Competition** | High (millions of games) | High but **discoverable** (utility keywords are high-intent search) |
| **Cross-promotion** | Utility users → see JellyBolt games in ads | Game users → see utility apps in "More by JellyBolt" |

### Utility App Portfolio

#### 🥇 Tier 1 — Ship First (Highest ROI, Fastest Build)

| # | App Name | Package | Category | Build Method | Ad Strategy | Why First |
|---|----------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **⚡ Bolt Calculator** | `com.jellybolt.calculator` | `TOOLS` | WebView (HTML/CSS/JS) | Banner (bottom) + interstitial on mode switch | Everyone needs a calculator. ASO gold. 2-day build. |
| 2 | **⚡ Bolt QR** | `com.jellybolt.qrscanner` | `TOOLS` | Native (CameraX + ZXing) | Interstitial after each scan + banner | QR scanning = daily use. Camera permission = native build needed. |
| 3 | **⚡ Bolt Timer** | `com.jellybolt.timer` | `TOOLS` | WebView (HTML/CSS/JS) | Banner (bottom) + reward video for custom sounds | Timer/stopwatch/countdown. Gym, cooking, studying. Multiple sessions/day. |

#### 🥈 Tier 2 — Ship Second (Strong Utility, Moderate Effort)

| # | App Name | Package | Category | Build Method | Ad Strategy | Why |
|---|----------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 4 | **⚡ Bolt Notes** | `com.jellybolt.notes` | `PRODUCTIVITY` | WebView (localStorage) | Banner + interstitial every 5th note open | Sticky utility. Users who adopt a notes app KEEP it. |
| 5 | **⚡ Bolt Convert** | `com.jellybolt.converter` | `TOOLS` | WebView (HTML/CSS/JS) | Banner + interstitial on category switch | Unit converter (length, weight, temp, currency). High search volume. |
| 6 | **⚡ Bolt Compass** | `com.jellybolt.compass` | `TOOLS` | Native (sensors) | Banner + interstitial on close | Compass + level + flashlight. Uses device sensors = native. |

#### 🥉 Tier 3 — Ship Third (Niche, Higher Effort)

| # | App Name | Package | Category | Build Method | Ad Strategy | Why |
|---|----------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 7 | **⚡ Bolt WiFi** | `com.jellybolt.wifianalyzer` | `TOOLS` | Native (WiFi APIs) | Banner + interstitial | WiFi analyzer. Niche but dedicated audience. Requires native APIs. |
| 8 | **⚡ Bolt Weather** | `com.jellybolt.weather` | `WEATHER` | WebView + API | Banner + interstitial | Weather widget. Needs API key (OpenWeatherMap free tier). |
| 9 | **⚡ Bolt Files** | `com.jellybolt.filemanager` | `TOOLS` | Native (Storage APIs) | Banner + interstitial | File manager lite. Complex permissions but high retention. |
| 10 | **⚡ Bolt Battery** | `com.jellybolt.battery` | `TOOLS` | Native (BatteryManager) | Banner + notification ads | Battery stats widget. Ongoing background presence = constant impressions. |

### Naming Convention

All utility apps follow the **"Bolt [Function]"** pattern:
- **Bolt Calculator**, **Bolt QR**, **Bolt Timer**, **Bolt Notes**, etc.
- Publisher remains "JellyBolt Games" on Play Store
- Package: `com.jellybolt.{function}`
- Icon: ⚡ bolt motif + function-specific icon element (e.g., bolt + magnifying glass for QR)

### Utility App Tech Stack

| Approach | When to Use | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **WebView (reuse game wrapper)** | No hardware APIs needed. Pure UI + logic. | Calculator, Timer, Notes, Unit Converter |
| **Native Android (Java/Kotlin)** | Needs camera, sensors, WiFi, filesystem | QR Scanner, Compass, WiFi Analyzer, File Manager |
| **WebView + Native bridge** | Mostly UI but one native feature | Weather (API call), Battery (BatteryManager) |

WebView utility apps reuse the exact same `GameActivity.java` WebView wrapper from our game apps — just point it at a different HTML file. Same build system, same signing, same CI/CD pipeline. Ship in hours.

### Visual Design — JellyBolt Utility Style

Utilities get the JellyBolt neon treatment but with a **functional twist**:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ Bolt Calculator                   │
│ ──────────────────────────────────── │
│                                      │
│           1,234.56                   │  ← White text on dark (#050510)
│                                      │
│  ┌────┬────┬────┬────┐              │
│  │ 7  │ 8  │ 9  │ ÷  │              │  ← Dark cards (#0d0d24)
│  ├────┼────┼────┼────┤              │     with neon green borders
│  │ 4  │ 5  │ 6  │ ×  │              │
│  ├────┼────┼────┼────┤              │
│  │ 1  │ 2  │ 3  │ −  │              │
│  ├────┼────┼────┼────┤              │
│  │ 0  │ .  │ =  │ +  │              │  ← = button: neon green (#00ff88)
│  └────┴────┴────┴────┘              │
│                                      │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │           [ Ad Banner ]          │ │  ← AdMob banner
│ └──────────────────────────────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Dark background (`#050510`) — same as games
- Neon green accents (`#00ff88`) — primary action buttons
- Electric cyan (`#58a6ff`) — secondary actions
- Functional first, beautiful second — utilities must feel fast and reliable
- ⚡ bolt icon in app bar

### Revenue Projections — Utility Apps

| Metric | Per Utility App (Month 6) | 10 Utility Apps Combined |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Daily Active Users | 500–2,000 | 5,000–20,000 |
| Sessions/day/user | 3–5 | 3–5 |
| Ad impressions/day | 1,500–10,000 | 15,000–100,000 |
| eCPM (banner) | $1–3 | $1–3 |
| eCPM (interstitial) | $5–15 | $5–15 |
| **Monthly revenue** | **$50–300** | **$500–3,000** |

Not game-changing individually, but **extremely low effort to maintain** once built. And every utility app cross-promotes the games.

## Appendix B: Why NOT Unity/Godot

Our brand promise is **instant play**. WASM engines destroy that:

| Factor | Our JS Games | Unity WebGL | Godot HTML5 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Load time | **< 100ms** | 3–10 seconds | 1–5 seconds |
| Game size | 7–65 KB | 15–50 MB | 5–15 MB |
| APK size | ~1.8 MB | ~20 MB+ | ~10 MB+ |
| RAM usage | 5–20 MB | 100–300 MB | 50–150 MB |
| Low-end devices | ✅ Works everywhere | ❌ Crashes on cheap phones | ⚠️ Laggy |
| WebView compat | ✅ Perfect | ❌ SharedArrayBuffer issues | ⚠️ WebGL1 only |

If we ever need AAA-quality native games, we'd build native Android apps — not WebView+WASM hybrids. For now, JavaScript IS our competitive moat.
